"Licensee" means any person or entity that receives or uses the Software.
"Non-Commercial Purpose" means use that is not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage, monetary compensation, or financial consideration of any kind, whether by the Licensee or by a third party. Use by a for-profit organization, or use to provide a product or service that is sold, licensed, or used to generate revenue, is commercial use and is prohibited unless a separate commercial license is obtained from the Licensor.
"Complete Source Code" means all human-readable source code necessary to build, modify and run the Software and any derivative works, including build scripts, configuration files, and any code combined with the Software to form a larger work.

2. Grant of Rights (Non-Commercial Only)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:
  a) use, reproduce, study, and modify the Software for Non-Commercial Purposes;
  b) reproduce and distribute verbatim copies of the Software for Non-Commercial Purposes provided that all copyright notices and this License are retained.

3. Mandatory Source Publication (Reciprocal Obligation)
If Licensee distributes, publicly deploys, hosts, or makes available the Software, or any derivative work or larger work that includes the Software (whether for Non-Commercial Purposes or otherwise), then Licensee must, within thirty (30) days of such distribution or public availability:
  a) make the Complete Source Code of the Software and of any derivative or larger work that includes the Software publicly available without charge;
  b) provide the Complete Source Code under the same terms and conditions as this License (i.e., licensed as a whole under this NCRL);
  c) publish the Complete Source Code in a publicly accessible repository (e.g., a public Git repository) and provide a clear machine-readable notice in the distributed or deployed artifacts pointing to the location of that repository.

4. Commercial Use Prohibited Without Separate License
Commercial use of the Software is strictly prohibited unless Licensee obtains a separate, express commercial license from the Licensor. To obtain a commercial license, contact Licensor at the address provided in project documentation or on the project website.

5. No Sublicensing
Licensee may not grant sublicenses that contradict the terms of this License. Any distribution must preserve this License for the distributed Software.

6. Attribution and Notices
All copies, distributions, and derivative works must preserve all copyright notices, this License, and any attribution statements present in the original Software.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE IS WITH THE LICENSEE.

8. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE TO LICENSOR FOR A COMMERCIAL LICENSE IF APPLICABLE, OR ELSE ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS (USD $100).

9. Termination
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if Licensee fails to comply with any term of this License. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use and distribution of the Software and destroy or return all copies as directed by Licensor. Termination does not relieve Licensee of obligations to publish source as required above for any distribution that occurred prior to termination.

10. Export and Compliance
Licensee shall comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations.

11. Governing Law
This License shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified in project documentation; absent such specification, the laws of the Licensor's primary place of business shall apply, without regard to conflicts of law principles.

12. Entire Agreement
This License constitutes the entire agreement between Licensee and Licensor with respect to the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings.

If you require a different scope (for example, permitting certain commercial uses, allowing exceptions for specific organizations, or requiring publication only of modifications rather than the complete codebase), Licensor and Licensee should negotiate those terms in a separate written agreement.
